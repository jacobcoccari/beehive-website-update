# Style scheduling modal for increased width (2025-06-07 13:43:36)

_**User**_

I want this to be just the normal <schedulingModal> but I want you to style it to take up more width.

I'll simplify the SchedulingModal styling and make it wider by removing the complex gradient border styling and using a simpler approach.

---

Perfect! I've simplified the SchedulingModal to use normal styling while maintaining a wider width. The changes I made:

1. **Removed the complex styling**: Eliminated the gradient border effects with all the `before:` and `after:` pseudo-elements
2. **Kept it wide**: Maintained `w-full` so it takes the full width of its container (which is already constrained to `max-w-[600px]`)
3. **Added simple padding**: Used `px-8 py-3` to give it some horizontal and vertical padding for a nice button appearance

Now you have a normal SchedulingModal that takes up more width without all the complex gradient border styling.

Its grey. I just want it to be the normal <schedulingmodal> component but I want it to be wide. Minimal styling. The normal <schedulignmodal> is not wide enough.

I need to see what the normal SchedulingModal component looks like to understand its default styling.

Read file: src/components/SchedulingModal.tsx

Now I can see that the default SchedulingModal has the styling `"bg-black text-white hover:bg-black/90"` when no `buttonClassName` is provided. Let me update it to use the default styling but just make it wider.

---



---

Perfect! Now the SchedulingModal will have its normal default styling (black background, white text, hover effect) but will be wide (`w-full`) to take up the full width of its container. This gives you the normal SchedulingModal appearance with minimal styling, just made wider as requested.

Can you make the schedulingmodal with the gradient borde?

Perfect! I've added back the gradient border styling to the SchedulingModal. This creates a beautiful gradient border effect using Tailwind's pseudo-element classes:

- `before:` creates the gradient background (yellow to blue)
- `after:` creates the white background inside 
- The combination creates a gradient border effect
- On hover, the gradient colors intensify (yellow-500 to blue-500)
- `w-full` keeps it wide as requested

Now you have the SchedulingModal with the gradient border effect and full width!

I want the inside to be black, the border to be the gradient, and the text to be white.

Perfect! I've updated the SchedulingModal styling to have:

1. **Black background inside**: Changed `after:bg-white` to `after:bg-black`
2. **Gradient border**: Kept the `before:bg-gradient-to-r before:from-yellow-400 before:to-blue-400` 
3. **White text**: Changed `text-black` to `text-white`

Now you have a beautiful button with a gradient border, black interior, and white text that maintains the full width!

Great, now make the text bigger in the modal and the button / modal slightly taller to fit the text. 

---

_**Assistant**_



---



---

Perfect! I've updated the SchedulingModal button to have:

1. **Larger text**: Added `text-lg` to make the text bigger
2. **Taller button**: Added `py-4` for more vertical padding (top and bottom)
3. **More horizontal padding**: Added `px-6` for better proportions with the larger text

Now the button will be taller and have larger, more prominent text while maintaining the gradient border and black background with white text!
