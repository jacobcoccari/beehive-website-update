# Integrate new component under banner (2025-06-07 14:15:13)

_**User**_

@SocialProof.tsx Just developed a new compionent. Can you integrate it right under the banner on @page.tsx

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you integrate the SocialProof component right under the banner (Hero Section) on the main page. Let me add the import and place the component in the correct location.

Perfect! I've successfully integrated your SocialProof component into the main page. Here's what I did:

1. **Added the import**: I imported `SocialProofComponent` from `@/components/SocialProof` at the top of the file with the other component imports.

2. **Positioned the component**: I placed the `<SocialProofComponent />` right after the Hero Section (banner) and before the Services Section, exactly where you requested.

The component is now positioned in the page flow as:
- Header
- Hero Section (banner)
- **Social Proof Section** ‚Üê newly added
- Services Section
- Case Studies Section
- About Section
- Blog Section
- CTA Section
- Footer

Your SocialProof component with its animated numbers, gradient background, and hover effects will now display prominently right after the main banner, giving visitors immediate credibility indicators as they scroll down the page.

Awesome! Your SocialProof component is now live on the homepage right after the hero banner. The animated numbers and gradient design will really help establish credibility and showcase your global impact to visitors as they scroll down.

The component looks great with its:
- Animated counters for 30,589+ professionals empowered
- 166 countries reach
- 80% Fortune 100 companies served
- Beautiful hover effects and gradient styling

Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with for the website?

@SocialProof.tsx @SocialProof.tsx I want you to change this component to use the gradient in the ehader found in everything else in @page.tsx . Also, I want you to remove the gradient in the background.

I'll update the SocialProof component to use the consistent yellow-to-blue gradient found throughout the page and remove the background gradient.

Perfect! I've updated the SocialProof component to match the consistent branding throughout your page:

## Changes Made:

1. **Removed background gradient**: Changed from `bg-gradient-to-b from-amber-50 to-teal-50` to a clean `py-16 px-4` background

2. **Updated title gradient**: Changed both "Global Impact" and "Results" to use the consistent `bg-gradient-to-r from-yellow-400 to-blue-400 bg-clip-text text-transparent` gradient found throughout the page

3. **Updated underline**: Changed from `from-amber-400 to-teal-600` to `from-yellow-400 to-blue-400`

4. **Updated all icon gradients**: All three cards now use the consistent `from-yellow-400 to-blue-400` gradient instead of the amber/teal variations

5. **Updated decorative elements**: Changed the floating dots to use `yellow-400` and `blue-400` colors instead of amber/teal

Now your SocialProof component perfectly matches the yellow-to-blue gradient theme used in the hero section, services section, about section, and throughout the rest of the page, creating a cohesive visual identity!

Ooh, I like verythign you did but i want you to change the icons back isndie of each of the cards back to the colors they were using before, those were good.

_**Assistant**_

I'll change the icon colors back to their original amber and teal gradients while keeping all the other updates!

---



---



---



---

Perfect! I've reverted the icon colors back to their original, more colorful gradients:

1. **Professionals Empowered**: Back to `from-amber-400 to-amber-500` (warm amber gradient)
2. **International Reach**: Back to `from-teal-500 to-teal-600` (cool teal gradient) 
3. **Fortune 100 Companies**: Back to `from-amber-500 to-teal-500` (amber-to-teal blend)

Now you have the best of both worlds:
- Consistent yellow-to-blue branding gradient in the titles and underline
- Clean background without the distracting gradient
- Original colorful and distinct icon gradients that provide nice visual variety and help differentiate each metric

The component now maintains visual cohesion with the page while keeping those eye-catching, unique icon colors!
