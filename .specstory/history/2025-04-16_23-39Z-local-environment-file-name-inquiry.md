<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking about a local environment file name in their project. Let me try to find this information by looking at relevant files in the project, particularly configuration files that might contain environment variables.

Based on the code in `src/lib/ghost.ts`, I can see that the project is using environment variables since there is a reference to `process.env.GHOST_CONTENT_API_KEY`. This indicates that the project is using environment variables, which are typically defined in files like `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.development`, etc.

Let me search for environment-related files in the project to find the specific local environment file name that's being used.</details></think>

Let me search for environment files in your project.

---

Tool use: **file_search**

<details>
            <summary>Searched codebase ".env" • **0** results</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

Let me search for any environment files in the project root directory:

Tool use: **list_dir**

            <summary>Listed current directory • **15** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📁 `src` |
| 📄 `.cursorindexingignore` |
| 📁 `.specstory` |
| 📄 `package.json` |
| 📁 `node_modules` |
| 📄 `pnpm-lock.yaml` |
| 📁 `.git` |
| 📄 `tsconfig.json` |
| 📁 `public` |
| 📄 `.gitignore` |
| 📄 `next-env.d.ts` |
| 📄 `next.config.ts` |
| 📄 `postcss.config.mjs` |
| 📄 `README.md` |
| 📄 `eslint.config.mjs` |

</details>

Let me check the gitignore file to see if it mentions any environment files:

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: .gitignore

---

Based on the .gitignore file, I can see that it ignores `.env*` files, which means the project uses environment files with names starting with `.env`. 

In a Next.js project (which this appears to be based on the presence of `next.config.ts` and `next-env.d.ts`), the standard local environment file names are:

- `.env.local` - For local environment variables that shouldn't be committed to git
- `.env.development.local` - For local development environment variables
- `.env` - For default environment variables

According to the .gitignore pattern `.env*`, all environment files are ignored in this project.

The local environment file you would typically use is `.env.local`
