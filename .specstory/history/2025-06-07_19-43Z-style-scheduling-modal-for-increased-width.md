# Style scheduling modal for increased width (2025-06-07 19:43Z)

_**User (2025-06-07 19:43Z)**_

I want this to be just the normal <schedulingModal> but I want you to style it to take up more width. 

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants to remove the complex styling from the SchedulingModal component and just make it a normal SchedulingModal but with more width. Looking at the current code, there's a very complex buttonClassName prop with gradient borders and lots of styling. They want to simplify this to just be a normal SchedulingModal but wider.

I need to:
1. Remove the complex buttonClassName prop
2. Add some simple styling to make it wider

Looking at the current code:
```tsx
<SchedulingModal buttonClassName="w-full border-2 border-transparent relative before:absolute before:inset-0 before:rounded-[inherit] before:p-[3px] before:bg-gradient-to-r before:from-yellow-400 before:to-blue-400 before:-z-10 after:absolute after:inset-[3px] after:rounded-[inherit] after:bg-white after:-z-10 text-black hover:before:from-yellow-500 hover:before:to-blue-500" />
```

I should replace this with something simpler but wider. I can use the buttonClassName prop but with much simpler styling focused on width.</details></think>

I'll simplify the SchedulingModal styling and make it wider by removing the complex gradient border styling and using a simpler approach.

Perfect! I've simplified the SchedulingModal to use normal styling while maintaining a wider width. The changes I made:

1. **Removed the complex styling**: Eliminated the gradient border effects with all the `before:` and `after:` pseudo-elements
2. **Kept it wide**: Maintained `w-full` so it takes the full width of its container (which is already constrained to `max-w-[600px]`)
3. **Added simple padding**: Used `px-8 py-3` to give it some horizontal and vertical padding for a nice button appearance

Now you have a normal SchedulingModal that takes up more width without all the complex gradient border styling.

_**User (2025-06-07 19:43Z)**_

Its grey. I just want it to be the normal <schedulingmodal> component but I want it to be wide. Minimal styling. The normal <schedulignmodal> is not wide enough.

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is saying the button is grey now and they want it to look like the normal SchedulingModal component but just wider. They want minimal styling. Let me check what the normal SchedulingModal looks like without any custom styling, and then just make it wider.

I should look at the SchedulingModal component to see what its default styling is, and then just apply width styling to make it wider while keeping the default appearance.</details></think>

I need to see what the normal SchedulingModal component looks like to understand its default styling.

Now I can see that the default SchedulingModal has the styling `"bg-black text-white hover:bg-black/90"` when no `buttonClassName` is provided. Let me update it to use the default styling but just make it wider.

Perfect! Now the SchedulingModal will have its normal default styling (black background, white text, hover effect) but will be wide (`w-full`) to take up the full width of its container. This gives you the normal SchedulingModal appearance with minimal styling, just made wider as requested.

_**User (2025-06-07 19:43Z)**_

Can you make the schedulingmodal with the gradient borde? 

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants to add the gradient border back to the SchedulingModal. Looking at the earlier version that was replaced, it had this complex styling:

```
buttonClassName="w-full border-2 border-transparent relative before:absolute before:inset-0 before:rounded-[inherit] before:p-[3px] before:bg-gradient-to-r before:from-yellow-400 before:to-blue-400 before:-z-10 after:absolute after:inset-[3px] after:rounded-[inherit] after:bg-white after:-z-10 text-black hover:before:from-yellow-500 hover:before:to-blue-500"
```

This creates a gradient border effect using pseudo-elements. I need to apply this styling back to the SchedulingModal.</details></think>

Perfect! I've added back the gradient border styling to the SchedulingModal. This creates a beautiful gradient border effect using Tailwind's pseudo-element classes:

- `before:` creates the gradient background (yellow to blue)
- `after:` creates the white background inside 
- The combination creates a gradient border effect
- On hover, the gradient colors intensify (yellow-500 to blue-500)
- `w-full` keeps it wide as requested

Now you have the SchedulingModal with the gradient border effect and full width!

_**User (2025-06-07 19:43Z)**_

I want the inside to be black, the border to be the gradient, and the text to be white. 

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants to modify the SchedulingModal button to have:
1. Black background inside
2. Gradient border
3. White text

Currently it has a white background inside (`after:bg-white`) and black text (`text-black`). I need to change this to have a black background inside and white text.

Looking at the current styling:
`w-full border-2 border-transparent relative before:absolute before:inset-0 before:rounded-[inherit] before:p-[3px] before:bg-gradient-to-r before:from-yellow-400 before:to-blue-400 before:-z-10 after:absolute after:inset-[3px] after:rounded-[inherit] after:bg-white after:-z-10 text-black hover:before:from-yellow-500 hover:before:to-blue-500`

I need to change:
- `after:bg-white` to `after:bg-black`
- `text-black` to `text-white`</details></think>

Perfect! I've updated the SchedulingModal styling to have:

1. **Black background inside**: Changed `after:bg-white` to `after:bg-black`
2. **Gradient border**: Kept the `before:bg-gradient-to-r before:from-yellow-400 before:to-blue-400` 
3. **White text**: Changed `text-black` to `text-white`

Now you have a beautiful button with a gradient border, black interior, and white text that maintains the full width!

_**User (2025-06-07 19:43Z)**_

Great, now make the text bigger in the modal and the button / modal slightly taller to fit the text. 

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to make the text bigger in the modal and make the button/modal slightly taller to fit the larger text. I need to add text size classes and height/padding classes to accommodate the larger text.

I'll add:
- A text size class like `text-lg` or `text-xl` for larger text
- Some additional padding or height to make the button taller to accommodate the larger text</details></think>

Perfect! I've updated the SchedulingModal button to have:

1. **Larger text**: Added `text-lg` to make the text bigger
2. **Taller button**: Added `py-4` for more vertical padding (top and bottom)
3. **More horizontal padding**: Added `px-6` for better proportions with the larger text

Now the button will be taller and have larger, more prominent text while maintaining the gradient border and black background with white text!
