# CTA Button Modification Request (2025-04-21 12:39:24)

_**User**_

I want you to change the following things:

1) Make the "schedule a consultation button larger" in the CTA.
2) I want that buitton to have the same modal as the "contant us" button from the header.

Ask questions first.

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you modify the CTA section's consultation button. First, I need to gather some information:

1. Let me check the Header component to see how the "Contact Us" modal is implemented.

---

Read file: src/components/Header.tsx

---

I see that the Header uses a `SchedulingModal` component. Let me check that component:

---

Read file: src/components/SchedulingModal.tsx

---

Now I have all the information I need. Here's what I understand:

1. The "Contact Us" button in the header uses a `SchedulingModal` component that:
   - Uses the Dialog component from your UI library
   - Embeds a Zcal scheduling widget
   - Has specific styling for the modal size and appearance

2. The CTA button currently:
   - Has a gradient border effect
   - Includes a calendar icon
   - Doesn't have the modal functionality

Would you like me to:
1. Make the CTA button larger by adding a specific size prop or custom size classes
2. Replace the current button with a `SchedulingModal` component while preserving its gradient border styling
3. Keep the calendar icon in the new implementation

Please confirm if this matches your requirements, and let me know if you have any specific preferences for the button size.

I want you to keep the modal implementation, use the existing "schedule a consultation" button, but I want you to remove the "learn more about our services" button and make the schedul a consulation button double wide. Pnpm is my package manager.

_**Assistant**_

I understand that you want to:
1. Keep the existing "Schedule a Consultation" button styling
2. Remove the "Learn more about our services" button
3. Make the "Schedule a Consultation" button take up double the width
4. Add the modal functionality from the SchedulingModal component

First, I'll modify the CTA section in page.tsx:

---

```diff
  import { CaseStudies } from "@/components/CaseStudies"
  import { getRecentPosts, Post } from "@/lib/ghost"
+ import { SchedulingModal } from "@/components/SchedulingModal"
  
  export const revalidate = 3600 // Revalidate every hour
                </p>
              </div>
-             <div className="flex flex-col gap-2 min-[400px]:flex-row justify-center">
-               <Button className="border-2 border-transparent relative before:absolute before:inset-0 before:rounded-[inherit] before:p-[3px] before:bg-gradient-to-r before:from-yellow-400 before:to-blue-400 before:-z-10 after:absolute after:inset-[3px] after:rounded-[inherit] after:bg-white after:-z-10 text-black hover:before:from-yellow-500 hover:before:to-blue-500">
-                 Schedule a Consultation
-                 <Calendar className="ml-2 h-4 w-4" />
-               </Button>
-               <Button variant="outline">Learn more about our services</Button>
+             <div className="flex justify-center">
+               <div className="w-full max-w-[600px]">
+                 <SchedulingModal buttonClassName="w-full border-2 border-transparent relative before:absolute before:inset-0 before:rounded-[inherit] before:p-[3px] before:bg-gradient-to-r before:from-yellow-400 before:to-blue-400 before:-z-10 after:absolute after:inset-[3px] after:rounded-[inherit] after:bg-white after:-z-10 text-black hover:before:from-yellow-500 hover:before:to-blue-500" />
+               </div>
              </div>
            </div>
```

I see we need to modify the SchedulingModal component to accept a buttonClassName prop. Let me update that:

---

Cancelled
