# Ghost CMS Article Refresh Issue (2025-04-16 19:51:22)

_**User**_

I created a brand new article on Ghost CMS (pictured). However, when I refresh my website, it does not refresh the articles that it feteches. Why isnt this happening on this page? Get to root causes do not coede.

_**Assistant**_

Looking at your blog page code and the issue you're describing, I can identify a few potential root causes for why new Ghost CMS articles aren't showing up immediately:

1. **Revalidation Time**: In your code, I notice this line at the top:
```4:4:src/app/blog/page.tsx
export const revalidate = 3600 // Revalidate every hour
```
This means Next.js will only revalidate this page's data once every hour (3600 seconds). So even if you add new content in Ghost CMS, your website won't fetch the new data until the next revalidation period.

2. **Ghost API Caching**: Ghost's Content API might also have its own caching layer. Even if you request new data, Ghost might serve cached data for performance reasons.

To fix this, you have a few options:

1. **Reduce Revalidation Time**: If you want more frequent updates, you could lower the revalidation time. However, be cautious as very frequent revalidations could impact performance and API usage.

2. **Force Revalidation**: You could implement a way to manually trigger revalidation when needed, especially after publishing new content.

3. **Remove Revalidation**: If you always want the latest content, you could remove the revalidation setting, but this would make every page request hit the Ghost API.

Would you like me to help you implement any of these solutions? Let me know which approach you'd prefer, and I can guide you through the changes needed.

Reduce revalidation time to every 60s.

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you modify the revalidation time from 3600 seconds (1 hour) to 60 seconds (1 minute).

Let me edit the file:

---

```diff
  import { Card, CardContent, CardFooter } from "@/components/ui/card"
  
- export const revalidate = 3600 // Revalidate every hour
+ export const revalidate = 60 // Revalidate every minute
  
  export default async function BlogPage() {
```
