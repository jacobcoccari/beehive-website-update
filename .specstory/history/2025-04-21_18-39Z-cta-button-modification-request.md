# CTA Button Modification Request (2025-04-21 18:39Z)

_**User (2025-04-21 18:40Z)**_

I want you to change the following things:

1) Make the "schedule a consultation button larger" in the CTA.
2) I want that buitton to have the same modal as the "contant us" button from the header.

Ask questions first.

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you modify the CTA section's consultation button. First, I need to gather some information:

1. Let me check the Header component to see how the "Contact Us" modal is implemented.

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: src/components/Header.tsx

---

I see that the Header uses a `SchedulingModal` component. Let me check that component:

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: src/components/SchedulingModal.tsx

---

Now I have all the information I need. Here's what I understand:

1. The "Contact Us" button in the header uses a `SchedulingModal` component that:
   - Uses the Dialog component from your UI library
   - Embeds a Zcal scheduling widget
   - Has specific styling for the modal size and appearance

2. The CTA button currently:
   - Has a gradient border effect
   - Includes a calendar icon
   - Doesn't have the modal functionality

Would you like me to:
1. Make the CTA button larger by adding a specific size prop or custom size classes
2. Replace the current button with a `SchedulingModal` component while preserving its gradient border styling
3. Keep the calendar icon in the new implementation

Please confirm if this matches your requirements, and let me know if you have any specific preferences for the button size.

I want you to keep the modal implementation, use the existing "schedule a consultation" button, but I want you to remove the "learn more about our services" button and make the schedul a consulation button double wide. Pnpm is my package manager.

_**Assistant**_

I understand that you want to:
1. Keep the existing "Schedule a Consultation" button styling
2. Remove the "Learn more about our services" button
3. Make the "Schedule a Consultation" button take up double the width
4. Add the modal functionality from the SchedulingModal component

First, I'll modify the CTA section in page.tsx:

I see we need to modify the SchedulingModal component to accept a buttonClassName prop. Let me update that:

The changes have been made successfully! I have:

1. Removed the "Learn more about our services" button
2. Made the "Schedule a Consultation" button take up more width (max-w-[600px])
3. Added the modal functionality while preserving the existing button styling
4. Added the calendar icon to match the original design

The button now:
- Uses the same Zcal scheduling widget as the header
- Maintains its gradient border styling
- Is wider (600px max width)
- Has the calendar icon
- Opens in a modal dialog

Is there anything else you'd like me to adjust about the button's appearance or functionality?
