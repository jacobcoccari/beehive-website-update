Let me search for environment files in your project.

Let me search for any environment files in the project root directory:

| 📄 `next.config.ts` |
| 📄 `postcss.config.mjs` |
| 📄 `README.md` |
| 📄 `eslint.config.mjs` |

</details>

Let me check the gitignore file to see if it mentions any environment files:

---

Read file: .gitignore

---

Based on the .gitignore file, I can see that it ignores `.env*` files, which means the project uses environment files with names starting with `.env`. 

In a Next.js project (which this appears to be based on the presence of `next.config.ts` and `next-env.d.ts`), the standard local environment file names are:

- `.env.local` - For local environment variables that shouldn't be committed to git
- `.env.development.local` - For local development environment variables
- `.env` - For default environment variables

According to the .gitignore pattern `.env*`, all environment files are ignored in this project.

The local environment file you would typically use is `.env.local`
