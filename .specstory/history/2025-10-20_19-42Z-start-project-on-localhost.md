# Start project on localhost (2025-10-20 19:42Z)

_**User (2025-10-20 19:42Z)**_

Can you get this started on localhost

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants to start the project on localhost. Let me first check the current state of the project to understand what we're working with.

Looking at the project structure, I can see:
- This appears to be a Next.js project (next.config.mjs, next-env.d.ts)
- It has a package.json file
- There's a pnpm-lock.yaml file, so they're using pnpm
- It's a TypeScript project (tsconfig.json)

To start this on localhost, I should:
1. First, check the package.json to see what scripts are available
2. Make sure dependencies are installed
3. Run the dev server

Let me start by reading the package.json to understand the project setup and available scripts.</details></think>

I'll help you get this Next.js project running on localhost. Let me first check the package.json to see what scripts are available.

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: /Users/giacobbe/src/projects/beehive-website/beehive-advisors-site/package.json

---

Perfect! I can see this is a Next.js project using pnpm. Now let me check if the dependencies are installed and then start the development server.

---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
cd /Users/giacobbe/src/projects/beehive-website/beehive-advisors-site && pnpm install
```

```

Done in 965ms using pnpm v10.8.0

```

Great! Dependencies are already installed. Now let me start the development server:

---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
cd /Users/giacobbe/src/projects/beehive-website/beehive-advisors-site && pnpm dev
```

---

Perfect! ðŸš€ The development server is now starting up. The Next.js app should be running on **http://localhost:3000** (this is the default Next.js dev port).

You can now:
- Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
- The server is running in the background and will hot-reload when you make changes to your code

The project appears to be a Beehive Advisors website with:
- Blog functionality (using Ghost CMS)
- Case studies
- Scheduling modal
- Various UI components

Is there anything specific you'd like me to help you with while working on this project?
