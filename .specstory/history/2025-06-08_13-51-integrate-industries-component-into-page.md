# Integrate Industries component into page (2025-06-08 07:51:44)

I want you to integrate @Industries.tsx into @page.tsx. I want it to replace the "success stores" section, just delete it.

I'll help you integrate the Industries component into the main page and replace the success stories section. I can see there's also a linter error in the Industries component that I'll fix first.

Let me start by fixing the linter error in Industries.tsx by removing the unused import:

---

```diff
  import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
  import { useEffect, useState } from "react"
- import { useMobile } from "@/hooks/use-mobile"
  
  interface IndustryCardProps {
```

```diff
  
  export default function IndustriesSection() {
-   const isMobile = useMobile()
    const [columns, setColumns] = useState(4)
  
```

---

Now I'll integrate the Industries component into the main page by importing it and replacing the CaseStudies section:

---



---

Now I need to replace the CaseStudies component usage with the IndustriesSection component:

---



---

Perfect! I've successfully:

1. **Fixed the linter error** in `Industries.tsx` by removing the unused `useMobile` import and related variable
2. **Imported the Industries component** into the main page
3. **Replaced the CaseStudies section** with the IndustriesSection component

The Industries component will now appear in place of the previous success stories section on your main page. The component features four industry cards (Commercial Real Estate, Utilities, Banking & Credit Unions, and Medical Practices) with descriptions and links to relevant blog posts, styled with the same design system as the rest of your site.

@Header.tsx Now I want you to change the header so when anyone clicks the beehive logo that appears in the top left corner of the screen, theyre brought back to /

I'll update the Header component to make the logo link to the home page ("/") instead of "#".

---



---

Perfect! Now when users click on the Beehive Advisors logo in the top left corner of the header, they will be taken back to the home page ("/"). This is a standard UX pattern that users expect, making the logo a quick way to return to the homepage from any page on the site.
