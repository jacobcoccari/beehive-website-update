# Integrate Industries component into page (2025-06-08 07:51:44)

I want you to integrate @Industries.tsx into @page.tsx. I want it to replace the "success stores" section, just delete it. 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I'll help you integrate the Industries component into the main page and replace the success stories section. I can see there's also a linter error in the Industries component that I'll fix first.

Let me start by fixing the linter error in Industries.tsx by removing the unused import:

---

```diff
  import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
  import { useEffect, useState } from "react"
- import { useMobile } from "@/hooks/use-mobile"
  
  interface IndustryCardProps {
```

```diff
  
  export default function IndustriesSection() {
-   const isMobile = useMobile()
    const [columns, setColumns] = useState(4)
  
```

---

Now I'll integrate the Industries component into the main page by importing it and replacing the CaseStudies section:

---



---

Now I need to replace the CaseStudies component usage with the IndustriesSection component:

---



---

Perfect! I've successfully:

1. **Fixed the linter error** in `Industries.tsx` by removing the unused `useMobile` import and related variable
2. **Imported the Industries component** into the main page
3. **Replaced the CaseStudies section** with the IndustriesSection component

The Industries component will now appear in place of the previous success stories section on your main page. The component features four industry cards (Commercial Real Estate, Utilities, Banking & Credit Unions, and Medical Practices) with descriptions and links to relevant blog posts, styled with the same design system as the rest of your site.

@Header.tsx Now I want you to change the header so when anyone clicks the beehive logo that appears in the top left corner of the screen, theyre brought back to /

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I'll update the Header component to make the logo link to the home page ("/") instead of "#".

---



---

Perfect! Now when users click on the Beehive Advisors logo in the top left corner of the header, they will be taken back to the home page ("/"). This is a standard UX pattern that users expect, making the logo a quick way to return to the homepage from any page on the site.

Now I want you to put "our services" AFTER "about beehive advisors" 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I'll rearrange the sections in the main page so that "Our Services" comes after "About Beehive Advisors". Let me move the Services section to appear after the About section.

---

Read file: src/app/page.tsx

---

Now I'll move the Services section to come after the About section. I need to cut the Services section and paste it after the About section:

---



---

Now I need to add the Services section after the About section:

---



---

Perfect! I've successfully rearranged the sections on your main page. The new order is now:

1. **Hero Section** 
2. **Social Proof Section**
3. **Industries Section** (the Industries component you wanted to integrate)
4. **About Beehive Advisors Section**
5. **Our Services Section** (moved here as requested)
6. **Blog Section**
7. **CTA Section**

The "Our Services" section now appears after the "About Beehive Advisors" section as you requested. This creates a better flow where visitors learn about the company first, then see what services you offer.

Now, I want you to change the @Header.tsx to link to the relevant sections. The website only has three types of pages:
1) Home
2) Blog
3) Blog article.

Therefore, all of the items in the header should either link to somwehre on the homepage or the blog page. when someone clicks something on the home page when they're currently on the home page, make sure the user experiecne is smooth as it slides to that part.

---

I'll update the Header component to properly link to the relevant sections. First, let me check if the Industries section has an ID, and then update all the navigation links accordingly.

---

Read file: src/components/Industries.tsx

---

I need to add an ID to the Industries section first, then update the header links. Let me add an ID to the Industries section:

---



---

Now I'll update the Header component to properly link to the sections. I'll change "Case Studies" to "Industries" and update all the links:

---



---

Perfect! I've updated the Header navigation to properly link to the relevant sections and pages. Here's what I changed:

1. **Home**: Now links to `"/"` instead of `"#"` - takes users to the homepage
2. **Industries**: Replaced "Case Studies" with "Industries" and links to `"#industries"` - the new Industries section 
3. **About**: Still links to `"#about"` - the About section on the homepage
4. **Services**: Still links to `"#services"` - the Services section on the homepage  
5. **Blog**: Now links to `"/blog"` instead of `"#blog"` - takes users to the blog page
6. **Contact**: Still links to `"#contact"` - the Contact/CTA section on the homepage

The navigation now follows the structure of your website with smooth scrolling to homepage sections when on the home page, and proper page navigation to the blog. The order also matches the flow of your homepage: Industries → About → Services → Blog → Contact.

"Industries" should like to the "industries" on the home page. Very close though!
