# Button Hover Effect Enhancement (2025-04-17 17:16Z)

_**User (2025-04-17 17:16Z)**_

Can you add a hover effect to this button

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you enhance the button with a hover effect. Looking at the current button, it already has a basic hover effect (`hover:bg-black/90`), but we can make it more engaging. I'll add a transition effect and a slight transform on hover to make it more interactive.

I'll edit the button's className to include these effects:

I've added the following effects to the button:
1. `transition-all`: This enables smooth transitions for all properties
2. `duration-200`: Sets the transition duration to 200ms for a smooth but quick effect
3. `hover:translate-x-1`: This adds a subtle right shift when hovering, which pairs well with the chevron icon to suggest forward movement

Now when you hover over the button, it will smoothly fade to a slightly transparent black and shift slightly to the right, creating a more engaging interactive experience that suggests forward movement. The effect is subtle but noticeable, maintaining professionalism while improving user feedback.

Would you like me to adjust the effect further or try a different style of hover animation?
