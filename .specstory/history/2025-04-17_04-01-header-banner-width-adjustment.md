# Header Banner Width Adjustment (2025-04-16 22:01:23)

_**User**_

@layout.tsx @page.tsx I want the content inside the header ('transform your business') to be as wide as the content in the header. To be clear, I want "tranform" to be wider. You keep messing up and making the header narrower, but I want the header to stay the same and the text and buttons inside of the page title "transform your business" to be wider

I understand you want the content inside the hero section (the "Transform Your Business..." text and buttons) to match the width of the header navigation above it, while keeping the header width unchanged. Let me help you adjust that.

First, I'll check the current layout structure and then make the necessary adjustments.

Looking at the code, I notice that the hero section is using `container-custom` class while having a different width than the header. Let me fix this by adjusting the container classes.

I'll edit the page.tsx file:

---

```diff
          {/* Hero Section */}
          <section className="full-width-gradient">
-           <div className="container-custom">
+           <div className="container mx-auto px-4 md:px-6">
              <div className="grid gap-6 lg:grid-cols-2 lg:gap-12 xl:grid-cols-2">
                <div className="flex flex-col justify-center space-y-4">
```

---

I've replaced the `container-custom` class with `container mx-auto px-4 md:px-6` to match the header's container styling. This will ensure that the hero section content aligns with the header width while maintaining consistent padding.

The change:
1. Removed the custom container class that was making the content narrower
2. Added the standard container class with auto margins
3. Added consistent padding that matches the header (px-4 for mobile, md:px-6 for larger screens)

This should now make the hero section content (including the "Transform Your Business..." text and buttons) span the same width as the header navigation while keeping the header unchanged. The content will be properly aligned and maintain consistent spacing across different screen sizes.

Would you like me to make any additional adjustments to the width or spacing?
