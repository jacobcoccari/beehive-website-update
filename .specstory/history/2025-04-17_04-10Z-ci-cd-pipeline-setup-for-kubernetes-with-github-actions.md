# CI/CD Pipeline Setup for Kubernetes with GitHub Actions (2025-04-17 04:10Z)

_**User (2025-04-17 04:12Z)**_

I want to create a CI/CD pipeline using github actions to, when I push anything to main on github, it automatically deploys my changes to my kubernetes cluster. 

Here is the current state of my kubernetes cluster (in terminal)

Remember, this website uses another service in the kubernetes cluster. Right now we are pointing it to the public domain ghost.beehive-advisors.com/...


Anyways, let's put together a plan to implement this.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to deploy your Next.js application to your Kubernetes cluster. Based on your cluster information, I can see you're running Ghost in a separate namespace, which your site is currently integrating with.

Here's the plan I propose:

1. Create a Docker image build and push workflow
2. Create Kubernetes manifests for your website deployment
3. Set up necessary GitHub secrets
4. Create the complete GitHub Actions workflow

Let me break down each step and then we'll implement them:

1. **Docker Setup**:
   - We'll need to create a Dockerfile for your Next.js application
   - We'll push to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) as it's well integrated with GitHub Actions

2. **Kubernetes Manifests Needed**:
   - Deployment manifest for your Next.js app
   - Service manifest
   - Ingress manifest to handle routing
   - ConfigMap/Secret for environment variables (including Ghost API connection)

3. **GitHub Secrets We'll Need**:
   - `KUBECONFIG` or individual cluster access credentials
   - `GHCR_TOKEN` for container registry access
   - Any sensitive environment variables

4. **GitHub Actions Workflow Steps**:
   - Trigger on push to main
   - Build Docker image
   - Push to GHCR
   - Update Kubernetes deployment
   - Verify deployment

Let me start by creating the Dockerfile first. I'll check if one exists:

---

Tool use: **file_search**

<details>
            <summary>Searched codebase "Dockerfile" • **0** results</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

---

Let me check the root directory structure:

---

Tool use: **list_dir**

<details>
            <summary>Listed current directory • **18** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📁 `.git` |
| 📁 `.next` |
| 📁 `public` |

| 📄 `package.json` |
| 📁 `node_modules` |
| 📄 `pnpm-lock.yaml` |
| 📁 `src` |
| 📄 `next.config.mjs` |
| 📄 `next-env.d.ts` |
| 📄 `.env.local` |

| 📁 `.specstory` |
| 📄 `tsconfig.json` |
| 📄 `.gitignore` |
| 📄 `README.md` |
| 📄 `eslint.config.mjs` |

</details>

---

Great! Let me outline the implementation steps we'll take:

1. First, I'll create a Dockerfile for your Next.js application
2. Then, create the Kubernetes manifests in a new `k8s` directory
3. Finally, create the GitHub Actions workflow

Let's start with the Dockerfile:

Perfect! I've set up all the necessary files for your CI/CD pipeline. Here's what you need to do to get this working:

1. **Set up GitHub Secrets**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository settings
   - Navigate to Secrets and Variables > Actions
   - Add the following secret:
     - `KUBECONFIG`: Your full kubeconfig file content (you can get this from `~/.kube/config`)

2. **Create the website namespace in your cluster**:
   Run this command:
   ```bash
   kubectl create namespace website
   ```

3. **Push these changes to your repository**:
   ```bash
   git add Dockerfile k8s/ .github/workflows/deploy.yaml next.config.mjs
   git commit -m "Add CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions"
   git push origin main
   ```

The workflow will:
1. Build a Docker image of your Next.js application
2. Push it to GitHub Container Registry
3. Deploy it to your Kubernetes cluster
4. Set up the necessary service and ingress

A few important notes:
- The deployment uses 2 replicas for high availability
- The ingress is configured to use Traefik (which I see you're using in your cluster)
- The Ghost URL is configured in the deployment
- Resource limits are set to reasonable defaults (adjust if needed)
- The workflow uses GitHub's built-in GITHUB_TOKEN for container registry access

Would you like me to explain any part of this setup in more detail or make any adjustments to the configuration?

Where is the kubernetes manifest applied? What if I want to keep the manifest in a different repo? The manifest is in the repo pictured. @https://github.com/jacobcoccari/fiberstate-kubernetes/tree/main/beehive-advisors 

---

_**Assistant**_

I see that you have your Kubernetes manifests in a separate repository at `fiberstate-kubernetes/beehive-advisors`. This is actually a good practice for GitOps and separation of concerns. Let's modify the GitHub Actions workflow to use the manifests from that repository instead of the local `k8s` directory.

Here's how we can modify the workflow:

Key changes I've made:

1. Added a step to checkout your infrastructure repository (`fiberstate-kubernetes`) into a subdirectory called `infra`
2. Updated the paths to point to the manifests in the infrastructure repo
3. Added an environment variable for the infrastructure repo name
4. Improved the sed command to be more robust when replacing the image

You'll need to set up two GitHub secrets for this to work:

1. `KUBECONFIG` - Your Kubernetes config file (which you already needed)
2. `INFRA_PAT` - A GitHub Personal Access Token with read access to your `fiberstate-kubernetes` repository

To create the PAT:
1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Generate a new token with `repo` scope (to read private repositories)
3. Add the token as a secret named `INFRA_PAT` in your website repository's secrets

This setup provides several benefits:
- Keeps infrastructure configuration separate from application code
- Allows you to version your infrastructure independently
- Makes it easier to manage multiple environments
- Follows GitOps best practices

We can also delete the local `k8s` directory since we're not using it anymore:

---

Tool use: **delete_file**

Removing the local k8s directory since we're using the manifests from the infrastructure repository

---

Now your CI/CD pipeline will:
1. Build and push your application image
2. Clone your infrastructure repository
3. Update the image reference in the manifest
4. Apply the updated manifest to your cluster

Would you like me to explain any part of this setup in more detail or make any adjustments?

_**User (2025-04-17 04:27Z)**_

2 things. Repo secret or environment secret. ALso, did we already point it towards the right repo or do we need to set that too? be concise. 

---

_**Assistant**_

For secrets, I recommend using Environment secrets since they provide better isolation and can be environment-specific. You can set them up at:
`Repository Settings → Environments → New environment → Add secrets`

Create an environment called `production` and add both `KUBECONFIG` and `INFRA_PAT` there.

We need to update the workflow to:
1. Specify the environment
2. Point to your actual repo

---

_**User (2025-04-17 04:28Z)**_

No, stop and think. I have not set it in github. Dont we need to set the correct repo? 

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah yes, you're absolutely right! The `INFRA_REPO` value needs to be set to your actual infrastructure repository. While I hardcoded `jacobcoccari/fiberstate-kubernetes` in the workflow file, we should verify this is correct.

Based on the screenshot you shared, it appears that is the correct repository name, but you should confirm:
1. Is `jacobcoccari/fiberstate-kubernetes` your infrastructure repository?
2. Is it public or private? (This affects what kind of PAT permissions we need)

Once you confirm, we can proceed with:
1. Creating the `production` environment in GitHub
2. Adding the `KUBECONFIG` and `INFRA_PAT` secrets
3. Verifying the `INFRA_REPO` value in the workflow matches your actual repository

Would you like me to make any adjustments to the `INFRA_REPO` value in the workflow?

---

_**User (2025-04-17 04:29Z)**_

Yes, its puublic but it might go private. I already added kube config but you told me to do it as a repo secret. Should I change it? 

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, I recommend moving the `KUBECONFIG` to be an environment secret instead of a repository secret for better security practices and environment isolation. Here's what to do:

1. Go to your repository settings → Environments → Create new environment called `production`
2. Add both secrets to this environment:
   - Move `KUBECONFIG` from repo secrets to this environment
   - Add `INFRA_PAT` with permissions to read private repos (in case you make it private later)

The workflow is already configured to use the `production` environment, so once you move the secrets, everything will work as expected.

Since the infrastructure repo is currently public, you could technically skip the `INFRA_PAT` for now, but I recommend setting it up anyway since you plan to potentially make it private later. This way you won't need to update the workflow when that happens.

Here's your kubeconfig. You can copy this entire output and add it as an environment secret named `KUBECONFIG` in your `production` environment settings in GitHub:

1. Go to repository settings
2. Environments → `production`
3. Add secret
4. Name: `KUBECONFIG`
5. Value: *paste the entire output above*

The kubeconfig contains all the necessary certificates and credentials to access your cluster at `38.46.221.209:6443`.

_**User (2025-04-17 04:31Z)**_

OK, ITS ALL READY TO GO IN GITHUB. WHAT IS NEXT>?

---

_**Assistant**_

Next steps:

1. Push the changes we made to trigger the workflow:
```bash
git add .github/workflows/deploy.yaml
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow"
git push origin main
```

2. After pushing, go to GitHub → Actions tab to monitor the deployment. The workflow should:
   - Build the Docker image
   - Push to GitHub Container Registry
   - Pull the manifest from fiberstate-kubernetes repo
   - Deploy to your cluster

Would you like me to help you push these changes or would you prefer to do it yourself?

Ok, i moniitored it and got this error:

buildx failed with: ERROR: failed to solve: process "/bin/sh -c pnpm build" did not complete successfully: exit code: 1


Follow best practices, isnt it better to not put secrets in dockerfile? 

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, you're absolutely right about secrets! Let's fix both issues:

1. The build error is happening because we need to handle environment variables for the build. Instead of putting them in the Dockerfile, we should:
   - Use build arguments during build time
   - Use Kubernetes secrets for runtime

Let me modify both the Dockerfile and the deployment:

---

Tool use: **edit_file**

Now let's update the GitHub Actions workflow to pass the build arg:

            cache-from: type=gha
            cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
```

</details>

---

Key changes made:
1. Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_GHOST_URL` as a build arg in Dockerfile
2. Passing the build arg in the GitHub Actions workflow
3. Removed hardcoded environment variables from Dockerfile

For even better security, you could:
1. Move the Ghost URL to GitHub environment secrets
2. Reference it in the workflow like: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GHOST_URL=${{ secrets.GHOST_URL }}`

Would you like me to make that additional security enhancement?

---

_**User (2025-04-17 04:35Z)**_

I'll update the workflow to use a secret for the Ghost URL:

</details>

---

Now you need to:
1. Go to GitHub repository → Settings → Environments → `production`
2. Add a new secret called `GHOST_URL` with value `https://ghost.beehive-advisors.com`

This way, the URL is stored securely in GitHub and not visible in your code.

For better security, we should use a Kubernetes Secret instead of having the URL directly in the deployment manifest. Here's how to modify it:

1. First, add a Secret manifest:

Key changes:
1. Created a separate `secrets.yaml` for the Ghost URL
2. Changed the env var in deployment to use `secretKeyRef` instead of hardcoded value
3. Fixed the env var name to `NEXT_PUBLIC_GHOST_URL` to match what Next.js expects

Now you can:
1. Apply the secret first: `kubectl apply -f k8s/secrets.yaml`
2. Then apply the deployment: `kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml`

This is more secure because:
- Secrets are base64 encoded in Kubernetes
- Secrets are stored encrypted in etcd
- The URL isn't visible in your Git repository
- You can easily update the URL without changing the deployment

Would you like me to help you apply these changes?

I see the issue - there's a TypeScript error in your blog page component. Let me help you fix that:

1. Let's fix the type error in `src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`. The `params` type needs to be corrected:

```typescript
interface BlogPostPageProps {
  params: { slug: string }  // Remove the Promise type
}

---

```bash
pnpm build

I see that we have a new type error. The issue is that Next.js expects the `params` property to be a Promise, but we're currently defining it as a simple object. Let's modify the interface to match Next.js's expected types:

I see that we need to handle the Promise nature of the params. Let's modify the component to properly handle the Promise by making it an async component:

I see that we need to install the `date-fns` package since it's being used for date formatting. Let me install that package:

Great! I've installed the `date-fns` package which should resolve the linter error. The package was successfully installed with version 4.1.0. 

Let me verify the current state of the file to ensure everything is working as expected:

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx

I notice that we have the `date-fns` package imported but we're still using a custom `formatDate` function from `@/lib/ghost`. Let me check that function to see if we need to update it:

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: src/lib/ghost.ts

---

I see that we have a custom `formatDate` function that uses the native JavaScript `toLocaleDateString`. Since we now have `date-fns` installed, we should update this to use `date-fns` for consistency and to take advantage of its more robust date formatting capabilities. Let me update the `ghost.ts` file:

</details>

---

I've made the following changes:
1. Added the import for `format` from `date-fns`
2. Updated the `formatDate` function to use `date-fns`'s `format` function instead of `toLocaleDateString`
3. The format string `'MMMM d, yyyy'` will produce the same output format as before:
   - `MMMM`: Full month name (e.g., "January")
   - `d`: Day of the month (e.g., "1")
   - `yyyy`: Full year (e.g., "2024")

This change maintains the same date format output but uses the more consistent and robust `date-fns` library. The output will still look like "January 1, 2024" but now it's using the same library as the rest of the codebase.

Would you like me to help you with anything else?

RouterGetting StartedImages and Fonts<br/><br/># How to optimize images and fonts<br/><br/>Next.js comes with automatic image and font optimization. This page will guide you through how to start using them.<br/><br/>## Optimizing images <br/><br/>The Next.js <Image> component extends the HTML `<img>` element to provide:<br/><br/>* **Size optimization:** Automatically serving correctly sized images for each device, using modern image formats like WebP.<br/>* **Visual stability:** Preventing layout shift automatically when images are loading.<br/>* **Faster page loads:** Only loading images when they enter the viewport using native browser lazy loading, with optional blur-up placeholders.<br/>* **Asset flexibility:** Resizing images on-demand, even images stored on remote servers.<br/><br/>To start using `<Image>`, import it from `next/image` and render it within your component.<br/><br/>app/page.tsx<br/><br/>TypeScript<br/><br/>JavaScriptTypeScript<br/><br/>```<br/>import Image from 'next/image'<br/> <br/>export default function Page() \{<br/>  return <Image src="" alt="" /><br/>\}<br/>```<br/><br/>The `src` property can be a local or remote image.<br/><br/>### Local images <br/><br/>You can store static files, like images and fonts, under a folder called `public` in the root directory. Files inside `public` can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (`/`).<br/><br/>Folder structure showing app and public foldersFolder structure showing app and public folders<br/><br/>app/page.tsx<br/><br/>TypeScript<br/><br/>JavaScriptTypeScript<br/><br/>```<br/>import Image from 'next/image'<br/>import profilePic from './me.png'<br/> <br/>export default function Page() \{<br/>  return (<br/>    <Image<br/>      src=\{profilePic\}<br/>      alt="Picture of the author"<br/>      // width=\{500\} automatically provided<br/>      // height=\{500\} automatically provided<br/>      // blurDataURL="data:..." automatically provided<br/>      // placeholder="blur" // Optional blur-up while loading<br/>    /><br/>  )<br/>\}<br/>```<br/><br/>Next.js will automatically determine the intrinsic width and height of your image based on the imported file. These values are used to determine the image ratio and prevent Cumulative Layout Shift while your image is loading.<br/><br/>### Remote images <br/><br/>To use a remote image, you can provide a URL string for the `src` property.<br/><br/>app/page.tsx<br/><br/>TypeScript<br/><br/>JavaScriptTypeScript<br/><br/>```<br/>import Image from 'next/image'<br/> <br/>export default function Page() \{<br/>  return (<br/>    <Image<br/>      src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-bucket/profile.png"<br/>      alt="Picture of the author"<br/>      width=\{500\}<br/>      height=\{500\}<br/>    /><br/>  )<br/>\}<br/>```<br/><br/>Since Next.js does not have access to remote files during the build process, you'll need to provide the width, height and optional blurDataURL props manually. The `width` and `height` are used to infer the correct aspect ratio of image and avoid layout shift from the image loading in.<br/><br/>To safely allow images from remote servers, you need to define a list of supported URL patterns in next.config.js. Be as specific as possible to prevent malicious usage. For example, the following configuration will only allow images from a specific AWS S3 bucket:<br/><br/>next.config.ts<br/><br/>TypeScript<br/><br/>JavaScriptTypeScript<br/><br/>```<br/>import \{ NextConfig \} from 'next'<br/> <br/>const config: NextConfig = \{<br/>  images: \{<br/>    remotePatterns: [<br/>      \{<br/>        protocol: 'https',<br/>        hostname: 's3.amazonaws.com',<br/>        port: '',<br/>        pathname: '/my-bucket/**',<br/>        search: '',<br/>      \},<br/>    ],<br/>  \},<br/>\}<br/> <br/>export default config<br/>```<br/><br/>## Optimizing fonts <br/><br/>The next/font module automatically optimizes your fonts and removes external network requests for improved privacy and performance.<br/><br/>It includes **built-in self-hosting** for any font file. This means you can optimally load web fonts with no layout shift.<br/><br/>To start using `next/font`, import it from next/font/local or next/font/google, call it as a function with the appropriate options, and set the `className` of the element you want to apply the font to. For example:<br/><br/>app/layout.tsx<br/><br/>TypeScript<br/><br/>JavaScriptTypeScript<br/><br/>```<br/>import \{ Geist \} from 'next/font/google'<br/> <br/>const geist = Geist(\{<br/>  subsets: ['latin'],<br/>\})<br/> <br/>export default function Layout(\{ children \}: \{ children: React.ReactNode \}) \{<br/>  return (<br/>    <html lang="en" className=\{geist.className\}><br/>      <body>\{children\}</body><br/>    </html><br/>  )<br/>\}<br/>```<br/><br/>### Google fonts <br/><br/>You can automatically self-host any Google Font. Fonts are included in the deployment and served from the same domain as your deployment, meaning no requests are sent to Google by the browser when the user visits your site.<br/><br/>To start using a Google Font, import your chosen font from `next/font/google`:<br/><br/>app/layout.tsx<br/><br/>TypeScript<br/><br/>JavaScriptTypeScript<br/><br/>```<br/>import \{ Geist \} from 'next/font/google'<br/> <br/>const geist = Geist(\{<br/>  subsets: ['latin'],<br/>\})<br/> <br/>export default function RootLayout(\{<br/>  children,<br/>\}: \{<br/>  children: React.ReactNode<br/>\}) \{<br/>  return (<br/>    <html lang="en" className=\{geist.className\}><br/>      <body>\{children\}</body><br/>    </html><br/>  )<br/>\}<br/>```<br/><br/>We recommend using variable fonts for the best performance and flexibility. But if you can't use a variable font, you will need to specify a weight:<br/><br/>app/layout.tsx<br/><br/>TypeScript<br/><br/>JavaScriptTypeScript<br/><br/>```<br/>import \{ Roboto \} from 'next/font/google'<br/> <br/>const roboto = Roboto(\{<br/>  weight: '400',<br/>  subsets: ['latin'],<br/>\})<br/> <br/>export default function RootLayout(\{<br/>  children,<br/>\}: \{<br/>  children: React.ReactNode<br/>\}) \{<br/>  return (<br/>    <html lang="en" className=\{roboto.className\}><br/>      <body>\{children\}</body><br/>    </html><br/>  )<br/>\}<br/>```<br/><br/>### Local fonts <br/><br/>To use a local font, import your font from `next/font/local` and specify the src of your local font file.<br/><br/>app/layout.tsx<br/><br/>TypeScript<br/><br/>JavaScriptTypeScript<br/><br/>```<br/>import localFont from 'next/font/local'<br/> <br/>const myFont = localFont(\{<br/>  src: './my-font.woff2',<br/>\})<br/> <br/>export default function RootLayout(\{<br/>  children,<br/>\}: \{<br/>  children: React.ReactNode<br/>\}) \{<br/>  return (<br/>    <html lang="en" className=\{myFont.className\}><br/>      <body>\{children\}</body><br/>    </html><br/>  )<br/>\}<br/>```<br/><br/>If you want to use multiple files for a single font family, `src` can be an array:<br/><br/>```<br/>const roboto = localFont(\{<br/>  src: [<br/>    \{<br/>      path: './Roboto-Regular.woff2',<br/>      weight: '400',<br/>      style: 'normal',<br/>    \},<br/>    \{<br/>      path: './Roboto-Italic.woff2',<br/>      weight: '400',<br/>      style: 'italic',<br/>    \},<br/>    \{<br/>      path: './Roboto-Bold.woff2',<br/>      weight: '700',<br/>      style: 'normal',<br/>    \},<br/>    \{<br/>      path: './Roboto-BoldItalic.woff2',<br/>      weight: '700',<br/>      style: 'italic',<br/>    \},<br/>  ],<br/>\})<br/>```<br/><br/>## API Reference<br/><br/>Learn more about the features mentioned in this page by reading the API Reference.<br/><br/>FontOptimizing loading web fonts with the built-in \`next/font\` loaders.ImageOptimize Images in your Next.js Application using the built-in \`next/image\` Component.<br/><br/>PreviousLayouts and PagesNextCSS<br/><br/>Was this helpful?<br/><br/>supported.<br/><br/>Send<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>#### Resources<br/><br/>DocsSupport PolicyLearnShowcaseBlogTeamAnalyticsNext.js ConfPreviews<br/><br/>#### More<br/><br/>Next.js CommerceContact SalesCommunityGitHubReleasesTelemetryGovernance<br/><br/>#### About Vercel<br/><br/>Next.js + VercelOpen Source SoftwareGitHubBlueskyX<br/><br/>#### Legal<br/><br/>Privacy PolicyCookie Preferences<br/><br/>#### Subscribe to our newsletter<br/><br/>Stay updated on new releases and features, guides, and case studies.<br/><br/>Subscribe<br/><br/>© 2025 Vercel, Inc.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>--- |

It seems we have a new error related to using `document` in a server component. Let me check the `BlogContent` component since that's likely where the issue is:

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: src/components/BlogContent.tsx

---

Let me check the `extractTableOfContents` function since that's likely where `document` is being used:

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: src/lib/toc.ts

---

I found the issue. The `extractTableOfContents` function is using `document` which is only available in the browser. We need to move this logic to a client component. Let's create a new client component for the table of contents:

We still have the same issue. Let's modify the `extractTableOfContents` function to use a different approach that doesn't rely on `document`:

Great! All the errors have been fixed. Here's a summary of what we did:

1. Fixed the Geist font import by:
   - Adding the correct import path: `import { GeistSans } from "geist/font/sans"`
   - Adding `transpilePackages: ["geist"]` to `next.config.js`

2. Fixed the unused imports in `blog/[slug]/page.tsx` by:
   - Removing unused imports: `format` and `parseISO` from `date-fns`

3. Fixed the `Post` type error by:
   - Adding the `featured` property to the `Post` interface
   - Adding the property to the `transformGhostPost` function

4. Fixed the `document is not defined` error by:
   - Creating a new client component `ClientBlogContent` to handle client-side functionality
   - Updating the server component `BlogContent` to use the client component
   - Modifying the `extractTableOfContents` function to use a regex-based approach instead of relying on `document`

The build is now successful, and all the errors have been resolved.
