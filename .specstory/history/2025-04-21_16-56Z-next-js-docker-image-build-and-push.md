# Next.js Docker Image Build and Push (2025-04-21 16:56Z)

_**User (2025-04-21 16:59Z)**_

can you help me build this nextjs into a docker image, and push it to latest in my dockerhub image registry? @Dockerfile 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you build and push the Docker image to DockerHub. First, we need to build the image using your Dockerfile and then push it to your DockerHub registry. However, I notice that we'll need your DockerHub username to properly tag and push the image.

Let me help you with the process:

1. First, I'll check if you're logged into DockerHub:

---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
docker login --help | cat
```

```
Usage:  docker login [OPTIONS] [SERVER]

Authenticate to a registry.
Defaults to Docker Hub if no server is specified.

Options:
  -p, --password string   Password or Personal Access Token (PAT)
      --password-stdin    Take the Password or Personal Access Token (PAT) from
stdin
  -u, --username string   Username

```

---

Before we proceed with building and pushing the image, I need to know your DockerHub username. Could you please provide:
1. Your DockerHub username
2. The desired name for your image (if different from the project name)

Once you provide these details, I can help you:
1. Build the Docker image with the correct tag
2. Push it to your DockerHub repository

Also, I notice your Dockerfile has a build argument `NEXT_PUBLIC_GHOST_URL`. Will you need to specify a value for this during the build process?

Please provide these details and I'll help you complete the process. If you haven't logged into DockerHub yet, I can also help you with that step.

---

_**User (2025-04-21 17:00Z)**_

Im logged in

---

_**Assistant**_

Great that you're logged in! Let me check your Docker username so we can properly tag the image:

---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
docker info | grep Username | cat
```

```
➜  beehive-advisors-site git:(revert) ✗ docker info | grep Username | cat
WARNING: DOCKER_INSECURE_NO_IPTABLES_RAW is set
WARNING: daemon is not using the default seccomp profile
?➜  beehive-advisors-site git:(revert) ?✗
```

---

I'll need your DockerHub username to properly tag the image. Could you please provide it? Once you share your username, I can help you build and push the image with commands like:

```bash
docker build -t username/beehive-advisors-site:latest .
docker push username/beehive-advisors-site:latest
```

Please share your DockerHub username and I'll help you complete the process. Also, let me know if you need to specify a value for the `NEXT_PUBLIC_GHOST_URL` build argument that I noticed in your Dockerfile.

Perfect! Now I'll help you build and push the Docker image to your DockerHub account. Let's do this step by step:

1. First, let's build the image with your DockerHub username:

---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
docker build -t giacobbbe/beehive-advisors-site:latest .
```

```

---

The build is in progress. Once it completes successfully, we'll push the image to DockerHub. Let me check the build status:

---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
docker images | grep beehive-advisors-site | cat
```

```
?➜  beehive-advisors-site 

```

---

The build is still in progress. Let's wait a moment and then check again:

---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
docker images | grep beehive-advisors-site | cat
```

```
?➜  beehive-advisors-site git:(revert) ?✗ 

```

---

I notice the build is taking some time, which is normal for a Next.js application. Let's wait for it to complete. Once the build finishes successfully, we'll push the image to DockerHub with:

```bash
docker push giacobbbe/beehive-advisors-site:latest
```

I'll keep monitoring the build progress. Please let me know if you see any error messages in your terminal, or when you see that the build has completed. Also, if you need to specify a value for `NEXT_PUBLIC_GHOST_URL`, please let me know and we can rebuild with that parameter.

_**Assistant**_

I notice you're trying to restart a Kubernetes deployment. The correct way to trigger a restart of a Kubernetes deployment is to either:

1. Rollout restart the deployment:

---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment beehive-website -n website
```

```
➜  beehive-advisors-site git:(revert) ✗ kubectl rollout restart deployment beehive-website -n website      k
ubectl rollout restart deployment beehive-website -n website
deployment.apps/beehive-website restarted
➜  beehive-advisors-site git:(revert) ✗
```

---

Let's monitor the rollout status to ensure it completes successfully:

---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment beehive-website -n website
```

```
?➜  beehive-advisors-site git:(revert) ?✗ kubectl rollout status deployment beehive-website -n website
Waiting for deployment "beehive-website" rollout to finish: 1 old replicas are pending termination...
Waiting for deployment "beehive-website" rollout to finish: 1 old replicas are pending termination...
deployment "beehive-website" successfully rolled out
➜  beehive-advisors-site git:(revert) ✗
```

---

Great! The deployment has been successfully restarted. Let's verify the new pod is running:

---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
kubectl get pods -n website
```

```
➜  beehive-advisors-site git:(revert) ✗ kubectl get pods -n website
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
beehive-website-6cb4cf7f5f-kvsn2   1/1     Running   0          41s
?➜  beehive-advisors-site git:(revert) ?✗
```

---

Perfect! The deployment has been successfully restarted and the new pod is up and running. You can see that:
1. The old pod has been terminated
2. A new pod (beehive-website-6cb4cf7f5f-kvsn2) is now running
3. The deployment rollout completed successfully

Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with?

I want to force merge the revert branch with main. In other words, I just want main to be the branch revert. Overwrite everything on main. 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you force merge the revert branch into main. Here's what we'll do:

1. First, let's make sure we're on the revert branch and everything is up to date:

---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
git checkout revert && git status | cat
```

```
➜  beehive-advisors-site git:(revert) ✗ git checkout revert && git status | cat
M       .gitignore
M       .specstory/history/2025-04-21_16-56-next-js-docker-image-build-and-push.md
M       .specstory/history/2025-04-21_17-04-fixing-pnpm-build-errors.md
Already on 'revert'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/revert'.
On branch revert
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/revert'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   .gitignore
        modified:   .specstory/history/2025-04-21_16-56-next-js-docker-image-build-and-push.md
        modified:   .specstory/history/2025-04-21_17-04-fixing-pnpm-build-errors.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
➜  beehive-advisors-site git:(revert) ✗
```

---

2. Now, let's switch to main and force it to be exactly like revert:

---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
git checkout main && git reset --hard revert && git push -f origin main
```

```
➜  beehive-advisors-site git:(revert) ✗ git checkout main && git reset --hard revert && git push -f origin m
<& git reset --hard revert && git push -f origin main
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:
        .specstory/history/2025-04-21_16-56-next-js-docker-image-build-and-push.md
        .specstory/history/2025-04-21_17-04-fixing-pnpm-build-errors.md
Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
Aborting
➜  beehive-advisors-site git:(revert) ✗
```

---

I see we have some local changes that need to be handled first. Let's stash them since they appear to be just history files:

---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
git stash --include-untracked && git checkout main && git reset --hard revert && git push -f origin main
```

```
<& git reset --hard revert && git push -f origin main
Saved working directory and index state WIP on revert: 00a5997 brap yeet repeat fixed the linter errors
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

 + 19cf845...00a5997 main -> main (forced update)
➜  beehive-advisors-site git:(revert) ✗
```

---

Perfect! The operation has been completed successfully. Here's what we did:
1. Stashed your local changes
2. Switched to the main branch
3. Reset main to exactly match the revert branch
4. Force pushed the changes to origin/main

The main branch is now exactly the same as the revert branch, both locally and on GitHub. If you need the stashed changes back, we can restore them with `git stash pop`, but since they were just history files, you might not need them.

Would you like me to verify the branches are now identical, or is there anything else you need help with?
