# Reordering Components in Page.tsx (2025-04-17 12:41:39)

_**User**_

@page.tsx I want to change the oreder of components on this page. I want it to be:

1) Stays the same (header)
2) Our services
3) Ready to transform your learning strategy?
4) Case studies
5) About beehive advisors
6) Blog

Does that make sense?

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you reorder the sections in `page.tsx`. Looking at the current structure, we have all these sections already, and we just need to reorder them while keeping their content intact. I'll make this change.

I'll edit the file to reorder the sections while maintaining all their content and functionality:

```diff
            </div>
          </section>
- 
-         {/* Blog Section */}
-         <BlogSection posts={posts} />
- 
-         {/* CTA Section */}
-         <section
-           id="contact"
-           className="full-width-gradient"

I've reordered the sections according to your request. The new order is now:

1. Header (unchanged at the top)
2. Hero section (unchanged)
3. Our Services section
4. "Ready to Transform Your Learning Strategy?" (CTA section)
5. Case Studies section
6. About Beehive Advisors section
7. Blog section
8. Footer (unchanged at the bottom)

The content of each section remains exactly the same - I've just reordered their positions in the document. All the functionality, styling, and content are preserved. The changes should be reflected immediately on your page. Would you like me to make any adjustments to this new order?
