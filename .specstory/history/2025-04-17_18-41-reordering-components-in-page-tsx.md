# Reordering Components in Page.tsx (2025-04-17 12:41:39)

_**User**_

@page.tsx I want to change the oreder of components on this page. I want it to be:

1) Stays the same (header)
2) Our services
3) Ready to transform your learning strategy?
4) Case studies
5) About beehive advisors
6) Blog

Does that make sense? 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you reorder the sections in `page.tsx`. Looking at the current structure, we have all these sections already, and we just need to reorder them while keeping their content intact. I'll make this change.

I'll edit the file to reorder the sections while maintaining all their content and functionality:

---

```diff
            </div>
          </section>
- 
-         {/* Blog Section */}
-         <BlogSection posts={posts} />
- 
-         {/* CTA Section */}
-         <section
-           id="contact"
-           className="full-width-gradient"

        </main>
        <Footer />
```

I've reordered the sections according to your request. The new order is now:

1. Header (unchanged at the top)
2. Hero section (unchanged)
3. Our Services section
4. "Ready to Transform Your Learning Strategy?" (CTA section)
5. Case Studies section
6. About Beehive Advisors section
7. Blog section
8. Footer (unchanged at the bottom)

The content of each section remains exactly the same - I've just reordered their positions in the document. All the functionality, styling, and content are preserved. The changes should be reflected immediately on your page. Would you like me to make any adjustments to this new order?

what are the beehive learning colors

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the code, I can see that Beehive's brand colors are consistently used throughout the site in gradients and other UI elements. The two main brand colors are:

1. Yellow: `#F4D03F` (a warm yellow color)
2. Blue: `#85C1E9` (a light blue color)

These colors are used in several places throughout the site, particularly in gradients that go from yellow to blue. You can see this in multiple places in the code:

1. In the text gradients: `from-yellow-400 to-blue-400`
2. In the hero section's decorative star shape (SVG gradient):
```tsx
<linearGradient id="paint0_linear">
  <stop stopColor="#F4D03F" /> <!-- Yellow -->
  <stop offset="1" stopColor="#85C1E9" /> <!-- Blue -->
</linearGradient>
```
3. In interactive elements like buttons with gradient borders

These colors appear to be the primary brand colors for Beehive Advisors, creating a cohesive visual identity that suggests energy (yellow) and trust/professionalism (blue).

Add the Utah Png to "about beehive advisors". there is currently no image

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you replace the placeholder image with the Utah PNG in the About section. First, let me check if the Utah PNG exists in the public directory.

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory public â€¢ **6** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| ðŸ“„ `Utah.svg` |
| ðŸ“„ `Insurance.png` |
| ðŸ“„ `Upskilling.png` |
| ðŸ“„ `Call center.png` |
| ðŸ“„ `Mobile Logo.svg` |
| ðŸ“„ `Desktop Logo.svg` |

</details>

---

I see there's a `Utah.svg` file in the public directory. I'll update the Image component in the About section to use this file instead of the placeholder.

---

```diff
                  <div className="relative h-[300px] w-[300px] sm:h-[400px] sm:w-[400px]">
                    <Image
-                     src="/placeholder.svg?height=400&width=400"
-                     alt="About Beehive Advisors"
+                     src="/Utah.svg"
+                     alt="Utah - Home of Beehive Advisors"
                      width={400}
                      height={400}
-                     className="rounded-lg shadow-lg"
+                     className="rounded-lg shadow-lg object-contain"
                    />
                  </div>
```

---

I've made the following changes:
1. Changed the image source from the placeholder to `/Utah.svg`
2. Updated the alt text to be more descriptive
3. Added `object-contain` to the className to ensure the SVG maintains its proper aspect ratio

The Utah SVG should now be displayed in the About section of your website. The image will be responsive and properly contained within its container while maintaining its aspect ratio. Is there anything else you'd like me to adjust about the image display?

Its overflowing. Observe what is wrong and fix it. 

---

_**Assistant**_

I notice in the image that the Utah SVG is overflowing its container. Let's fix this by adjusting the container and image styling to ensure proper containment and sizing.

---

```diff
                </div>
                <div className="flex items-center justify-center">
-                 <div className="relative h-[300px] w-[300px] sm:h-[400px] sm:w-[400px]">
+                 <div className="relative w-full max-w-[400px] aspect-square">
                    <Image
                      src="/Utah.svg"
                      alt="Utah - Home of Beehive Advisors"
-                     width={400}
-                     height={400}
-                     className="rounded-lg shadow-lg object-contain"
+                     fill
+                     className="p-4 object-contain"
+                     priority
                    />
                  </div>
```

---

I've made several important changes to fix the overflow issue:

1. Changed the container to use `aspect-square` to maintain a perfect square ratio
2. Used `w-full` with `max-w-[400px]` to make it responsive while limiting maximum size
3. Switched to using `fill` prop on the Image component instead of fixed dimensions
4. Added padding (`p-4`) to ensure the image has some breathing room
5. Removed the fixed height/width constraints
6. Added `priority` to ensure the image loads quickly as it's above the fold
7. Kept `object-contain` to maintain aspect ratio
