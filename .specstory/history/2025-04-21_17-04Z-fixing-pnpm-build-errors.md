# Fixing pnpm Build Errors (2025-04-21 17:04Z)

_**User (2025-04-21 17:04Z)**_

Help with these pnpm build errros

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you fix these build errors. There are two main types of issues:

1. Unescaped single quotes (`'`) in JSX/TSX files
2. Unused imports/variables

Let me help you fix these one by one. I'll first check the relevant files and then make the necessary corrections.

Let's start with the unescaped quotes issues:

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: src/app/blog/[slug]/not-found.tsx

---

Let me fix these issues one by one. I'll start with the files that have unescaped quotes:

1. First, let's fix the `not-found.tsx` file by replacing the apostrophe with `&apos;`:

Let me fix the unescaped quotes in these files. For the unused imports, I'll check those files next.

Now that we've fixed all the issues, let's summarize what we've done:

1. Fixed unescaped quotes:
   - Replaced `'` with `&apos;` in `not-found.tsx`
   - Replaced `'` with `&apos;` in `BlogSection.tsx`
   - Replaced `'` with `&apos;` in `CaseStudies.tsx`

2. Removed unused imports:
   - Removed `GeistMono` from `layout.tsx`
   - Removed `CardDescription`, `Tabs`, `TabsContent`, `TabsList`, `TabsTrigger`, `ArrowRight`, and `Quote` from `page.tsx`
   - Removed unused `Author` and `Tag` imports from `ghost.ts`

These changes should resolve all the build errors. You can now try running `pnpm build` again. The build should complete successfully without the ESLint errors we saw before.

Would you like me to help you with anything else?

_**User (2025-04-21 17:08Z)**_

Just a few more to fix!

I see there are still a few more ESLint errors to fix. Let me address them:

---

Looking at the code, the `Post` type is actually used implicitly through the `getSinglePost` and `getPosts` functions, but TypeScript is still flagging it as unused. We can remove it since it's already imported through `@/lib/ghost`:

_**User (2025-04-21 17:09Z)**_

One last error

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I see the issue. There's a type error in `src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` where the `params` type in `BlogPostPageProps` interface doesn't match Next.js's expected `PageProps` type. Let me fix that:

I've made the following changes:
1. Updated the `BlogPostPageProps` interface to match Next.js's expected page props structure
2. Added the optional `searchParams` property that Next.js expects
3. Removed the unnecessary Promise resolution since params will always be a plain object in Next.js pages
4. Updated the code to use `params.slug` directly instead of `resolvedParams.slug`

This should resolve the type error. The build should now complete successfully. Would you like me to help with anything else?

_**User (2025-04-21 17:11Z)**_

Ah, I see the issue now. The error is more specific - Next.js is expecting `params` to be a Promise. Let me fix that:

I've updated the code to:
1. Make `params` accept either a Promise or a direct object, as Next.js expects
2. Restored the `Promise.resolve()` handling since params might be a Promise
3. Use `resolvedParams.slug` consistently throughout the code

This should now match Next.js's type expectations and fix the build error. Would you like me to help with anything else?

---

_**User (2025-04-21 17:12Z)**_

Still messed up! Really think abouit it before you code anything. 

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, now I see the exact error more clearly. Let me analyze it carefully:

The error states:
```
Type 'Promise<{ slug: string; }> | { slug: string; }' is not assignable to type 'Promise<any> | undefined'
```

The key insight is that Next.js's `PageProps` expects `params` to be either a Promise OR undefined, but NOT a plain object. Our current union type of `Promise<{ slug: string }> | { slug: string }` doesn't match this.

Let me fix this properly:

Now the changes are correct because:
1. `params` is typed as `Promise<{ slug: string }> | undefined` which exactly matches Next.js's expectations
2. We first check if `params` exists at all
3. Then we await the Promise to get the actual parameters
4. The rest of the logic remains the same

This should now properly match Next.js's type constraints and fix the build error. Would you like me to help with anything else?

_**User (2025-04-21 17:13Z)**_

PPlease dear god think about it before you change anything DO NOT CODE JUST INVESTIGATE

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, NOW I see the real error clearly. Let me analyze it properly:

The error message says:
```
Type 'BlogPostPageProps' does not satisfy the constraint 'PageProps'.
  Types of property 'searchParams' are incompatible.
    Type '{ [key: string]: string | string[] | undefined; } | undefined' is not assignable to type 'Promise<any> | undefined'.
      Type '{ [key: string]: string | string[] | undefined; }' is missing the following properties from type 'Promise<any>': then, catch, finally, [Symbol.toStringTag]
```

The key insight here is:
1. The error is about `searchParams`, not `params` as we were incorrectly focusing on
2. Next.js expects `searchParams` to be either a Promise or undefined
3. We currently have it typed as a plain object or undefined
4. This is a Next.js 13+ App Router page, where both `params` AND `searchParams` need to be Promise-compatible

So the correct interface should have BOTH properties as Promise-compatible. Let me think about the exact type before making any changes. Would you like me to proceed with the fix now that I understand the actual issue?

---

_**User (2025-04-21 17:15Z)**_

Go.

The changes are now correct because:
1. We're using Next.js's own `PageProps` type pattern which is the correct way to type pages in the App Router
2. We've removed all the Promise-related code since Next.js handles that internally
3. We're using a generic type parameter to specify the shape of our params
4. The type properly includes both `params` and `searchParams` with their correct types

Help with these errors

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, now I see the real issue. The error `ReferenceError: document is not defined` is occurring during server-side rendering because we're trying to use the `document` object which only exists in the browser.

This typically happens when using client-side only features during server-side rendering. Looking at the components in the blog post page, this is likely coming from the `ClientTableOfContents` component since it's probably trying to manipulate the DOM.

Let me fix this by making the `ClientTableOfContents` component client-side only using Next.js's `'use client'` directive:

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: src/components/ClientTableOfContents.tsx

---

I see that the `'use client'` directive is already there. Let's check the `TableOfContents` component since it might be using browser APIs:

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: src/components/TableOfContents.tsx

---

Now let's check the `extractTableOfContents` function since that might be using `document`:

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: src/lib/toc.ts

---

Found it! The issue is in `toc.ts`. The `extractTableOfContents` function is using `document.createElement` during server-side rendering. Let's fix this by using a DOM parser that works on both server and client:

I've made the following changes:
1. Removed the `'use client'` directive since this function no longer needs browser APIs
2. Replaced the DOM manipulation with regex-based parsing that works on both server and client
3. Added support for both headings with and without IDs
4. Made the parsing more robust by handling edge cases

This should fix the `document is not defined` error during server-side rendering since we're no longer using any browser APIs in the table of contents generation. Would you like me to help with anything else?

Fix this

_**Assistant**_

Ah, simple fix - we have an unused variable `fullMatch` in the regex destructuring. Let's remove it since we don't need it:

I've replaced `[fullMatch, level, text]` with `[, level, text]` since we don't use the `fullMatch` variable. The underscore prefix tells TypeScript that we're intentionally ignoring that value. This should fix the ESLint error about unused variables.

i want to ignore the specstory directory in my gitignore.

I'll add the specstory directory to your .gitignore file:

I've added `specstory/` to your .gitignore file. This will:
1. Ignore the entire specstory directory and all its contents
2. Prevent Git from tracking any files in that directory
3. Keep these files out of your repository

The changes will take effect immediately for any new files, but if you've already committed any files from the specstory directory, you'll need to remove them from Git's tracking. Would you like me to help you with that?
